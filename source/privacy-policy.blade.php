			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Fees, Payments & Cancellation Policy</h4>
			<p>
				You agree to pay for the Services you use on the Outgrow Site in accordance the pricing and payment terms presented to you for that service. Fees paid by you are non-refundable.
			</p>
			<p>
				For subscriptions, you will be billed in advance on a recurring cycle for the period you have selected (monthly or annually or quarterly) at the beginning of that period. Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each period unless you cancel automatic renewal at least 48 hours before your next renewal date. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Outgrow may change the fees charged for Services at any time, provided that, for subscription Services, the change will become effective only upon the next renewal date.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Cancellation Policy</h4>
			<p>
				Your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each period unless you cancel automatic renewal at least 48 hours before your next renewal date. If you decide to cancel, no refund will be provided for fees paid or past bills and your service will remain active through the end of the existing license period.
			</p>
			<p>
				At the end of the license period, you will no longer be charged. If you cancel within 48 hours of your next renewal date, the next renewal will go through but that will be your last renewal and the cancellation will take effect on the following renewal as it is required that you cancel at least 48 hours prior to the renewal date. Note: The length of your license can be longer than your billing period for example an annual license, billed semi-annually would mean that a cancellation on month 4 will take effect at the end of the annual license and the second semiannual bill on month 6 will continue as well as the remaining 8 months of the subscription.  
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Upgrades</h4>
			<p>
				An upgrade is when a paying customer decides to change their current plan to a more expensive paid plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				When upgrading in the middle of a billing period, you will be given a pro-rated credit (not a refund) for the current plan which will be applied to the pro-rated charges for the upgraded plan. At the end of the billing period, the upgraded plan will auto-renew.
			</p>
			<h4 class="Privacy-subheading">Downgrades</h4>
			<p>
				A downgrade is when a paying customer chooses to change their plan from a more expensive to a less expensive (but still paid) plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				When downgrading in the middle of a billing period, your account downgrade will apply at the end of the period and to the following period but will not impact the existing billing period.
			</p>
